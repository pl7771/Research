  abstract = {Abstract The aims of this study were to evaluate the Body Mass Index (BMI) (weight/stature2) as a proxy for percent body fat (\%BF) and to determine its association with fat-free mass (FFM). Multivariate analysis of variance and partial correlations were used to examine relationships between BMI and \%BF and FFM from densitometry for 504 men and 511 women, aged 20 to 45 years. Sensitivity/specificity analyses used cut offs of 28 kg/m2 in men and 26 kg/m2 in women for BMI, and 25\% in men and 33\% in women for \%BF. Significantly higher associations existed in each gender between BMI and \%BF in the upper BMI tertile than in the lower BMI tertiles. In the lower BMI tertiles, correlations between BMI and FFM were approximately twice as large as those between BMI and \%BF. The BMI correctly identified about 44\% of obese men, and 52\% of obese women when obesity was determined from \%BF. BMI is an uncertain diagnostic index of obesity. Results of Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analyses using \%BF and total body fat, both provided a BMI of 25 kg/m2 in men and 23 kg/m2 in women as diagnostic screening cut offs for obesity.},

  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A Physical activity is beneficial to children’s health, yet academic pressures limit opportunities for students throughout the school day. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a classroom PA intervention on student academic performance outcomes. Intervention participants (n=15) received daily PA breaks. Reading and mathematics fluency, PA, grades, and standardized test scores were collected. Effects of the intervention were examined using mixed-design ANOVAs. Intervention students had significantly higher reading fluency and mathematics scores post-intervention and higher means for standardized reading and mathematics scores as well as grades. Short bouts of PA are important for improving CBM math and reading fluency scores. Classroom teachers should be encouraged to devote time during academic learning to incorporate PA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
  comment      = {Dit onderzoek bestaat uit 2 delen. Enerzijds wordt onderzocht wat de impact is van fysieke activiteit interventie in de klas op academische prestatie van studenten. En anderzijds wordt onderzocht of leerstof-gebaseerde-testen gebruikt kunnen worden als type test in dit eerste onderzoek.
In dit literatuuronderzoek focussen wij ons vooral op dit eerste doel binnen deze studie.

Het onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd m.b.v 2 klassen met leerling(Mavg = 8.87). Bij 1 klas wordt de interventie uitgevoerd, de andere klas is de controle groep.
Bij de interventie klas werd iedere dag de les 20 minuten onderbroken voor een fysieke activiteit gerelateerd aan de les en dit gedurende 20 weken.

Beide klassen werden vooraf en driemaal tijdens het onderzoek getest  op "reading and mathematics fluency" d.m.v leerstof-gebaseerde-testen, gestandaardiseerde testen en scores gegeven door de leerkracht. 

Uit de resultaten kon geconcludeerd worden dat de fysieke interventies een positieve invloed hadden op de academische prestatie van de studenten. Dit effect was het grootst op de wiskunde testen.},

We estimate fixed-effects models using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our primary measure of academic achievement is the student’s GPA abstracted from official school transcripts. We find that increases in alcohol consumption result in small yet statistically significant reductions in GPA for male students and in statistically non-significant changes for females. For females, however, higher levels of drinking result in self-reported academic difficulty. The fixed-effects results are substantially smaller than OLS estimates, underscoring the importance of addressing unobserved individual heterogeneity.},

To ascertain  the main  objective  of the  study, descriptive  survey design  was  employed.  The study  used  100 senior  high  school students comprising  59  student-athletes  and  41  non-student  athletes.  For  data  collection,  each respondent was presented with the research questionnaire designed for the study. The study revealed that, there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of student-athletes and non-student athletes in mathematics. The study, however, concluded that, sports participation  has  no  negative  effects  on  students-athletes’  academic  performance  in mathematics. What this finding implies is that, parents and mathematics teachers should not seize students from participating in sporting activities with the fear that participating in sports worsens academic performance.},

  abstract  = {Background: This study aimed to examine differences in socio-demographics and health behaviour between Belgian first year university students who attended all final course exams and those who did not. Secondly, this study aimed to identify weight and health behaviour related correlates of academic performance in those students who attended all course exams.
Methods: Anthropometrics of 101 first year university students were measured at both the beginning of the first (T1) and second (T2) semester of the academic year. An on-line health behaviour questionnaire was filled out at T2. As a measure of academic performance student end-of-year Grade Point Averages (GPA) were obtained from the university's registration office. Independent samples t-tests and chi(2)-tests were executed to compare students who attended all course exams during the first year of university and students who did not carry through. Uni- and multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to identify correlates of academic performance in students who attended all course exams during the first year of university.
Results: Students who did not attend all course exams were predominantly male, showed higher increases in waist circumference during the first semester and consumed more French fries than those who attended all final course exams. Being male, lower secondary school grades, increases in weight, Body Mass Index and waist circumference over the first semester, more gaming on weekdays, being on a diet, eating at the student restaurant more frequently, higher soda and French fries consumption, and higher frequency of alcohol use predicted lower GPA's in first year university students. When controlled for each other, being on a diet and higher frequency of alcohol use remained significant in the multivariate regression model, with frequency of alcohol use being the strongest correlate of GPA.
Conclusions: This study, conducted in Belgian first year university students, showed that academic performance is associated with a wide range of weight and health related behaviours. Future studies should investigate whether interventions aiming at promoting healthy behaviours among students could also have a positive impact on academic performance.},
